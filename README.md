# forloop R Package

This is a basic R package developed for a class assignment by Alasya Zeweldi and Gabriela L.

It includes two functions:
- `col_means(df)`: Computes column means of a data frame using a for-loop.
- `count_na(x)`: Counts the number of `NA` values in a vector using a for-loop.

All functions were created without using `colMeans()` or `sum(is.na())`, and follow base R logic with manual iteration.

The package passes `R CMD check` with no errors.
